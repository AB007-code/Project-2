<!--Limitation Of Number Datatype-->
<!--If we are passing a float value and add with some float value then it could not give exact value.The output will be in double float precision. Number has a limited maximum and minimum value.
 ex. let x=0.34
    let y=0.56
    let res=x+y;
    console.log(res)
    // 0.90000000004456 (Double Precision Floating number
    1. Incorrect results with inexact numbers
    2. Float computing is not determine
    3. very large or very small number cannot give right ouput when using integers)-->
